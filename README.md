# Painter-Application
Painter Application implemented using OOP Java
The Painter Application is an object-oriented model that covers the following geometric shapes: Line Segment, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle (Right angled and Isosceles), Rectangle and Square. Manipulation of those shapes is made possible using our application. 

Functionalities present in the model:
1. GUI that allows the following functionalities for the user on all the shapes defined: draw, color, resize, delete, copy and move.  
2. Undo or redo any action performed.
3. The cursor should be used to select the location of a shape while drawing it, or moving it to another location
4. For the copy, a shape could be selected for copy, and pasted in any other spot of the drawing canvas.

Design patterns used to facilitate the implementation of the application:
1. Abstract Factory
2. Factory
3. Singleton
4. Prototype
5. Iterator
6. Composite
7. Memento
8. Mediator

How the SOLID principles where implemented together with the UML diagrams of the application can be viewed in the PDF report uploaded.
